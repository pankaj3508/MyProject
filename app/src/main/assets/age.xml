<answer>
33
</answer>
<explanation>
Explanation:
Three consecutive numbers can be taken as (P - 1), P, (P + 1).
So, (P - 1) + P + (P + 1) = 102
3P = 102 => P = 34.
The lowest of the three = (P - 1) = 34 - 1 = 33.

<answer>
28
</answer>
<explanation>
Explanation:
Any two digit number can be written as (10P + Q), where P is the digit in the tens place and Q is the digit in the units place.
P + Q = 10 ----- (1)
(10Q + P) - (10P + Q) = 54
9(Q - P) = 54
(Q - P) = 6 ----- (2)
Solve (1) and (2) P = 2 and Q = 8
The required number is = 28

<answer>
14
</answer>
<explanation>
Explanation:
Three consecutive even numbers (2P - 2), 2P, (2P + 2).
(2P - 2) + 2P + (2P + 2) = 42
6P = 42 => P = 7.
The middle number is: 2P = 14.

 The numerator of a certain fraction is 8 less than the denominator. If 3 is added to the numerator and 3 is subtracted from the denominator, the fraction becomes 3/4. Find the original fraction?
</que>
<option1>
2/5
</option1>
<option2>
7/9
</option2>
<option3>
3/11
</option3>
<option4>
8/5
</option4>
<answer>
3/11
</answer>
<explanation>
Explanation:
The denominator be P, the numerator will be (P - 8).
The fraction will be (P - 8)/P.
Adding 3 to the numerator and subtracting 3 from the denominator, (P - 8 + 3)/(P - 3) = 3/4.
(P - 5)/(P - 3) = 3/4
P = 20 - 9 => P = 11.
The fraction is: 3/11.

<option1>
50
</option1>
<option2>
60
</option2>
<option3>
70
</option3>
<option4>
80
</option4>
<answer>
70
</answer>
<explanation>
Explanation:
A + B = 60, A = 2B
2B + B = 60 => B = 20 then A = 40.
5 years, their ages will be 45 and 25.
Sum of their ages = 45 + 25 = 70.
